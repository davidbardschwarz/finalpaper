  <br>In this site I want to explore the use of audio in Playdead's <i>Limbo</i>; listen to the 
  way the game begins right before the boy wakes up:</br>
  <audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="limbo.audio.opening.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
  <br>To me this sound suggests a kind of "sonorous envelope" described by Anzieu in <i>The Skin Ego</i> 
  (note 1).
now Having heard the sounds, now listen and look to how the visual works with the audio:</br>
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="limbo.opening.two.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
</video>
  <br>The black and white color scheme and the strange, other-worldly appearance of this odd forest
  in which the boy is sleeping suggest a dystopic environment, a dreamscape, or some sort of
  world of the dead (note 2).</br>
